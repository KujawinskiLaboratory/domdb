The database organizes LC-MS data and metadata to allow efficient querying of data from metabolomics experiments. The database is described in this manuscript: Longnecker, K., J. Futrelle, E. Coburn, M.C. Kido Soule and E.B. Kujawinski (in press). Environmental metabolomics: databases and tools for data analysis. Mar Chem: DOI: 10.1016/j.marchem.2015.06.012 

The manuscript is available here: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2015.06.012. 

The wiki describes how to install and use the software.

Update to transfer to new organization: KujawinskiLaboratory. All prior commits for KujawinskiLaboratory were Krista Longnecker, whose GitHub account is now @redbluewater
